I have obtained a job as a Frontend Developer. Unlike my previous experience, at [Virtualspirit](https://www.virtualspirit.me) all tasks are carried out virtually through the [Virtual Space](https://www.virtualspace.ai) platform. I really like this because I can work from home without having to migrate and go to the office.

## Probation

During the 3-month probation period, I have worked on various tasks ranging from translating designs into code to integrating with APIs from different features and modules. I have also collaborated with **Project Management**, **Team Leader**, **Backend Developers**, and other **Frontend Developers**.

The technology used in Virtualspirit also tends to be the same as previous work, and the materials at bootcamp.

1. Next.js
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Redux
5. React Query
