My colleague, [Fariz Rachman Yusuf](https://www.farizrachmanyusuf.com), and I collaborated to perform a complete migration of [www.bangjeff.com](https://www.bangjeff.com). Previously built on a **Laravel Monolith**, we transitioned it to use **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for the frontend and **Go-Lang** for the backend.

This migration aims to enhance performance and reduce server costs while maintaining seamless traffic flow. The website processes hundreds of transactions daily.

1. Next.js
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS
4. React Query
5. MDX v2

## Challenges

Indeed, conducting a migration of such a large-scale website is not an easy task. There are numerous challenges and considerations to be addressed, such as **Security**, **Performance**, **User Experience**, **SEO**, and **more**.

My colleague, **Fariz Rachman Yusuf**, and I are consistently conducting research to ensure that this project continues to evolve and improve.

## Responsibilities

1. I am responsible for developing the frontend of the [main website](https://www.bangjeff.com), the [documentation website](https://docs.bangjeff.com), and making a modest contribution to the **admin panel website**.
2. I am also in charge of maintaining the websites, which involves fixing bugs and adding new features when necessary.
3. Collaborating to integrate them with APIs and the admin panel.

Thank you.
