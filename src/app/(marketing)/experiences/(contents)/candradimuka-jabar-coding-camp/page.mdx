I enthusiastically participated in the [Jabar Coding Camp](https://jabarcodingcamp.jabarprov.go.id) 2021 Bootcamp's online phase, focusing on the React.js class. This immersive program spanned from August 2021 to September 2021. Throughout this one-month period, I diligently engaged in various training modules and weekly assignments, which ultimately paved the way for my qualification to proceed to the next stage of the camp.

## Qualification for Jabar Coding Camp 2021's Offline Intensive Phase

I am thrilled to share that I successfully secured a spot in the offline phase of the Jabar Coding Camp 2021. This achievement comes after completing the online training scholarship and excelling in the React.js Frontend Developer class. The ensuing six-month offline phase took place in Bandung, during which I had the unique opportunity to deepen my learning and enhance my skills.

In Bandung, I had the pleasure of meeting 23 other talented individuals from diverse backgrounds, representing various classes and regions within West Java. As part of the training, we were organized into teams to cultivate our collaborative abilities, a crucial aspect of the modern development landscape.

During the intensive training program, I gained proficiency in a range of topics, including:

1. Fundamentals of UI/UX Design
2. Advanced JavaScript and TypeScript
3. Mastery of React.js and Next.js
4. Comprehensive understanding of PWA, Testing, and Tailwind CSS
5. Effective utilization of Git for collaboration, along with insights into Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum
6. Personal growth and self-development
