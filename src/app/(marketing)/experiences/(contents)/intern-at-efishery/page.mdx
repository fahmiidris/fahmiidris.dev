During the last month of the Jabar Coding Camp program, participants like myself engaged in internships with various Jabar Coding Camp partner companies. In this phase, I was specifically placed at [eFishery](https://www.efishery.com), working within the Feeder Ops section as a Frontend Developer for a span of 3 months.

## Acquisition of New Technological Knowledge

The internship provided a plethora of invaluable experiences that have greatly enriched my skill set. I had the privilege of acquiring proficiency in several new technologies:

1. Implementation of NX for monorepo development
2. Exploring React Native
3. Familiarity with Express.js
4. Immersive Learning in Agile Deployment

Throughout the internship, I was exposed to the principles of Agile Deployment, allowing me to gain insight into efficient development and deployment workflows.

## My Role and Activities During the Internship

One of my prominent responsibilities during the internship was enhancing the **eFishery Internal Dashboard** and **FTS Tools App**. Specifically, I worked on implementing a feature termed the "**Expired Ticket**", which automatically manages tickets to expired status after longer than 30 days.

Furthermore, I had the opportunity to integrate webviews into the mobile application. Although the task was ostensibly straightforward, I encountered challenges during the setup and execution phases.

## Completion and Graduation

After dedicating three months to the internship program, I proudly graduated with a wealth of insights and valuable relationships. As part of my graduation requirements, I was entrusted with the task of crafting a presentation. For those interested, the presentation can be accessed at [https://graduation-efishery.netlify.app](https://graduation-efishery.netlify.app).

## Gratitude and Closing Thoughts
